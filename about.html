				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p class="bodyText">
					2DaRescue is a 501c3 non-profit, no-kill, all-breed dog rescue founded in response to the growing number of dogs suffering on our streets, in county shelters as well as other regions where dogs need help. We are passionate about our rescue efforts in Rocky Point and in New Mexico as well.
				</p>
				<p class="bodyText">
					We know no boundaries when we can help a helpless dog who suffers. We are rescue partners with our East County, West County, Pinal County, Az Humane Society, Graham County, Holbrook and do rescue work on our reservations too. We are also a partner with PACC 911.
				</p>

				<p class="bodyText">
					My name is Karen Franklin and I am the founder of 2DaRescue. After retiring from a 20 year career in trauma/ER nursing I decided to pursue my passion for rescuing dogs with a much deeper commitment. Through the years I have explored different options for housing the fur babies we save and have found that while a physical shelter is in many ways optimal, the commitment, budget, and barriers regarding zoning became impossible to manage. We started a foster based program and now after 6 long years have returned to being foster-based again. Finding dedicated fosters is a challenge but I feel that a dog is evaluated and recovers quicker in a loving home. 
				</p>
				<p class="bodyText">
					With the help of our amazing volunteers and fosters, we have had over 6 years of success, saving over 1500 lives. Our success is fostered by the amazing board members we have who have stayed consistent and dedicated despite the struggles, and there have been many. Tina Meredith is not only our Secretary, she functions as our marketer, our fundraiser, our social media corresponder and so much more!

					We thank you for taking the time to read about us and hope you continue to look through our website at all of the amazing stories of the dogs we have rescued, rehabilitated - both physically and mentally - and rehomed. To know us is to love and admire our passionate work.
